# Just Http Requests
JHR provides a simple interface to send HTTP requests to wherever. It:
- Runs locally
- Works in your browser
- Sends stuff to localhost
- Saves your requests
- Doesn't give you an crap about signing in


This acts to serve as an intermediate between something bloated and annoying like Postman and just using cURL or wuzz.
