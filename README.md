# Just Http Requests

JHR provides a simple interface to send HTTP requests to wherever. It:

- Runs locally
- Works in your browser
- Sends stuff to localhost
- Saves your requests
- Doesn't give you an crap about signing in

This acts to serve as an intermediate between something bloated and annoying like Postman and just using cURL or wuzz.

# Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `bun run dev` or `npm run dev` probably works fine too
3. Open `localhost:8008` to send http requests
4. Make an alias or whatever to do that faster

# Contributing

I'll accept contributions if I feel like it. No formality needed you can swear in your PR if you want.
